Fuzzy sets generalize classical sets## since the indicator functions (aka characteristic functions) of classical sets are special cases of the membership functions of fuzzy sets## if the latter only take values 0 or 1. In fuzzy set theory## classical bivalent sets are usually called crisp sets. The fuzzy set theory can be used in a wide range of domains in which information is incomplete or imprecise## such as bioinformatics.

The resulting vectors (each being a linear combination of the variables and containing n observations) are an uncorrelated orthogonal basis set. PCA is sensitive to the relative scaling of the original variables.

It is often used in artificial intelligence applications and research. Normally## the term rule-based system is applied to systems involving human-crafted or curated rule sets. Rule-based systems constructed using automatic rule inference## such as rule-based machine learning## are normally excluded from this system type.
what is the satisfiability?, In mathematical logic## satisfiability and validity are elementary concepts of semantics. A formula is satisfiable if it is possible to find an interpretation (model) that makes the formula true. A formula is valid if all interpretations make the formula true. The opposites of these concepts are unsatisfiability and invalidity## that is## a formula is unsatisfiable if none of the interpretations make the formula true## and invalid if some such interpretation makes the formula false. These four concepts are related to each other in a manner exactly analogous to Aristotle's square of opposition.

It is a directed or undirected graph consisting of vertices## which represent concepts## and edges## which represent semantic relations between concepts## mapping or connecting semantic fields.
what is a frame network?, A knowledge base that represents semantic relations between concepts in a network. This is often used as a form of knowledge representation. It is a directed or undirected graph consisting of vertices## which represent concepts## and edges## which represent semantic relations between concepts## mapping or connecting semantic fields.

The inference rules are commonly specified by means of an ontology language## and often a description logic language. Many reasoners use first-order predicate logic to perform reasoning; inference commonly proceeds by forward chaining and backward chaining.

what is a semantic query?, Allows for queries and analytics of associative and contextual nature. Semantic queries enable the retrieval of both explicitly and implicitly derived information based on syntactic## semantic and structural information contained in data. They are designed to deliver precise results (possibly the distinctive selection of one single piece of information) or to answer more fuzzy and wide-open questions through pattern matching and digital reasoning.
what is the semantics?, In programming language theory## semantics is the field concerned with the rigorous mathematical study of the meaning of programming languages. It does so by evaluating the meaning of syntactically valid strings defined by a specific programming language## showing the computation involved. In such a case that the evaluation would be of syntactically invalid strings## the result would be non-computation. Semantics describes the processes a computer follows when executing a program in that specific language. This can be shown by describing the relationship between the input and output of a program## or an explanation of how the program will be executed on a certain platform## hence creating a model of computation.

Examples are assigning a given email to the "spam" or "non-spam" class## and assigning a diagnosis to a given patient based on observed characteristics of the patient (sex## blood pressure## presence or absence of certain symptoms## etc.). Classification is an example of pattern recognition.
what is the statistical relational learning?, A subdiscipline of artificial intelligence and machine learning that is concerned with domain models that exhibit both uncertainty (which can be dealt with using statistical methods) and complex## relational structure. Note that SRL is sometimes called Relational Machine Learning (RML) in the literature. Typically## the knowledge representation formalisms developed in SRL use (a subset of) first-order logic to describe relational properties of a domain in a general manner (universal quantification) and draw upon probabilistic graphical models (such as Bayesian networks or Markov networks) to model the uncertainty; some also build upon the methods of inductive logic programming.

For stochastic problems## the random variables appear in the formulation of the optimization problem itself## which involves random objective functions or random constraints.

Some stochastic optimization methods use random iterates to solve stochastic problems## combining both meanings of stochastic optimization. Stochastic optimization methods generalize deterministic methods for deterministic problems.

Stochastic models generally use the definition of segments of words as basic semantic units for the semantic models## and in some cases involve a two layered approach. 
what is the superintelligence?, A hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted human minds. Superintelligence may also refer to a property of problem-solving systems (e.g.## superintelligent language translators or engineering assistants) whether or not these high-level intellectual competencies are embodied in agents that act within the physical world. A superintelligence may or may not be created by an intelligence explosion and be associated with a technological singularity.
what is the supervised learning?, The machine learning task of learning a function that maps an input to an output based on example input-output pairs. It infers a function from labeled training data consisting of a set of training examples. In supervised learning## each example is a pair consisting of an input object (typically a vector) and a desired output value (also called the supervisory signal). A supervised learning algorithm analyzes the training data and produces an inferred function## which can be used for mapping new examples. An optimal scenario will allow for the algorithm to correctly determine the class labels for unseen instances. This requires the learning algorithm to generalize from the training data to unseen situations in a "reasonable" way (see inductive bias).

It consists of states and transitions between states## which may be labeled with labels chosen from a set; the same label may appear on more than one transition. If the label set is a singleton## the system is essentially unlabeled## and a simpler definition that omits the labels is possible.

what is the true quantified Boolean formula?, In computational complexity theory## the language TQBF is a formal language consisting of the true quantified Boolean formulas. A (fully) quantified Boolean formula is a formula in quantified propositional logic where every variable is quantified (or bound)## using either existential or universal quantifiers## at the beginning of the sentence. Such a formula is equivalent to either true or false (since there are no free variables). If such a formula evaluates to true## then that formula is in the language TQBF. It is also known as QSAT (Quantified SAT).
what is the Turing test?, A test of a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behaviour equivalent to## or indistinguishable from## that of a human## developed by Alan Turing in 1950. Turing proposed that a human evaluator would judge natural language conversations between a human and a machine designed to generate human-like responses. The evaluator would be aware that one of the two partners in conversation is a machine## and all participants would be separated from one another. The conversation would be limited to a text-only channel such as a computer keyboard and screen so the result would not depend on the machine's ability to render words as speech. If the evaluator cannot reliably tell the machine from the human## the machine is said to have passed the test. The test results do not depend on the machine's ability to give correct answers to questions## only how closely its answers resemble those a human would give.
what is the unsupervised learning?, A type of self-organized Hebbian learning that helps find previously unknown patterns in data set without pre-existing labels. It is also known as self-organization and allows modeling probability densities of given inputs. It is one of the main three categories of machine learning## along with supervised and reinforcement learning. Semi-supervised learning has also been described and is a hybridization of supervised and unsupervised techniques.
